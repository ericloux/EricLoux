                            After taking the test, I was identified as the "Virtuoso" archetype. This is an ISTP type, showing that I am introverted rather than extroverted, sensing rather than intuiting, thinking rather than feeling, and prospecting rather than judging.

                            With this archetype come a number of strengths and weaknesses. I thought that many of these descriptors are dead on for me!
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Optimistic</strong>: Although I didn't always consider myself to be an optimist, I definitely see myself that way. "Life is a teacher to the wise man and an enemy to the fool."</li>
                            <li><strong>Creative</strong>: I've written music for orchestras, made films, assembled chain maille, and let my creativity manifest itself in a multitude as ways.</li>
                            <li><strong>Level-headed</strong>: They list this as a strength on the results, but I think it can be taken too far. I remember many times where I was sitting in my boss's office as he told me that he needed me to show a "sense of urgency," yet he also admitted that I didn't have any trouble with procrastinating or missing deadlines.</li>
                            <li><strong>Private</strong>: I'm definitely an introvert. Most of my communication is functional, and I'll almost never talk about my emotions.</li>
                            <li><strong>Bored Easily</strong>: It's very easy for me to get involved in a project, but then abandoning it because I lost interest in seeing it to completion. Once I solve all the interesting problems and only have the legwork left, I'm on to the next thing.</li>

                            This section was probably the least accurate, although some points definitely hit home. I don't do well with people who try to control me, and I have issues with expression my emotions.

                            According to the information here, a lot of my friendships are centered around hobbies, rather than... well, however everyone else makes friends. Shoutout to all the folks from my jiu jitsu gym!

                            Since I'm not a parent, I can't speak for the accuracy of the information here, but I think it seems accurate based on what I guess I'd be like. According to these results, I would be one to give my children a loose reign and encourage them to get out and interact with the world, rather than passively sitting around all day. Most importantly, I would be one to encourage my children's interests, without forcing them to pursue anything.

                            There are a few traits that definitely resonate here with me. The desire for lack of repetition is something that I agree with. I once had a job in a glassware factory. One of the positions was a press operator, where I stood at a screenprinting press and loaded a glass, watched it print, then put it on a conveyor belt. Sometimes I did that same operation 2000 times an hour. It was boring and I hated it! However, one of the positions was the press assistant, where I got the glass ready for the operator, made sure he had ink, wiped off any bad prints, and had to pretty much do a variety of tasks to keep the press running. I absolutely loved that position!

                            There are a few things that resonate in this section as well. I'm definitely blunt to the point where I can be misunderstood, but I don't mean to seem antagonistic. Loving pranks is also true - at the same glassware factory, I had a lead that would constantly try and push my buttons. We drew a symbol that looked suspiciously like a hand with a middle finger extended, and would each always draw that symbol where the other would find it. At my current job, I would decrease the touchpad sensitivity on my co-worker's laptop once a day when he left it unguarded. It was slow enough of a change that he didn't notice it, but watching him swipe his finger over and over again to only move his cursor partway across the page was hilarious to me. Even moreso when I asked him whether he was having trouble with his touchpad and he grumbled about it, only to have a look of realization a few seconds later when he realized what was going on and laughingly called me a name I won't print here.

                        <p>
                            In conclusion, I feel like I learned a lot about myself in this exercise. People with my personality type are natural problem solvers who love learning and exploring. Although my lack of focus can be seen as a negative, it can also be turned into a strength if I focus my energies into a specific goal.
