            CSS Games
        </h3>
        <p>
            <p>As part of my Savvy Coders experience, I was introduced to three separate web applications designed to teach various aspects of CSS. </p>
            <p>The first, <em>"Flexbox Froggy"</em>, taught the basics of using flexbox. At first, it was difficult to see the application, but after using a flexbox to create a navigation menu that grew dynamically as I added new elements, I saw one use for them.</p>
            <p>The second, <em>"Grid Garden"</em>, was a demonstration of how to use grids in CSS. I saw the potential in these immediately, and after one of the instructors introduced the concepts of Bootstrap, I created layouts that better utilized the screen space to look neater. </p>
            <p>The final game, <em>"CSS Diner"</em>, was my least favorite of the three. Although it demonstrated the multitude of ways that you could use CSS selectors to individually target HTML elements, it seemed easier to just use classes and IDs to achieve the same goal in a clearer manner.</p>
            <p>I enjoyed being able to play these games, and found them to be a fun and engaging method of learning the basics of flexbox, grid, and CSS selectors. </p>
